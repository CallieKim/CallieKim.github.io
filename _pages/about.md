Hi, I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in the [People and Robots Laboratory](https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/staff/kim-callie/) at the Computer Sciences Department of University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by [Bilge Mutlu](http://bilgemutlu.com). I completed my BS in Computer Science and Engineering at Ewha Womans University in 2019 and my MS in Computer Science at the University of Maryland in 2021.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on human-centered approaches to end-user robot programming. I investigate how to design interactive systems that help users specify, verify, and refine robot behavior through three complementary mechanisms: *scaffolding* that structures intent expression, *verification* that makes robot interpretation transparent, and *proactivity* that enables robots to anticipate ambiguity and elicit clarification. My work spans augmented reality interfaces, multi-agent LLM architectures, and empirical studies of how people communicate task intent to robots.

## Beyond Research

When I'm not working on robots, I enjoy reading books and playing games — especially fantasy RPGs. I also have a background in game development from my undergrad years, which you can check out on my [Projects](/projects/) page.
