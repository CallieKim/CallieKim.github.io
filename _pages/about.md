Hi, I am a fifth-year PhD student in the [People and Robots Laboratory](https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/staff/kim-callie/) at the Computer Sciences Department of University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by [Bilge Mutlu](http://bilgemutlu.com). I completed my BS in Computer Science and Engineering at Ewha Womans University in 2019 and my MS in Computer Science at the University of Maryland in 2021.

## Research Interests
My research focuses on human-centered approaches to improve interactions between users and AI-driven robotic systems. I explore methods to enhance feedback mechanisms and system reliability, with applications in robotics, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence. 

Currently, I am developing interactive feedback frameworks to improve the quality of robot programs generated by large language models (LLMs). This includes optimizing robot movement for efficiency and safety, designing effective feedback visualizations for users, and identifying the control features users need most. I also explore how to help users non-experts learn and refine their robot programming skills. By integrating user-centered design with systematic evaluation, my work aims to bridge the gap between expert-level programming and everyday users, making LLM-based robotics solutions more robust, accessible, and trustworthy.
