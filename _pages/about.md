Hi, I am a fourth-year PhD student in the [People and Robots Laboratory](https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/staff/kim-callie/) at the Computer Sciences Department of University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by [Bilge Mutlu](http://bilgemutlu.com).

My research focuses on enhancing user feedback mechanisms and reliability in LLM-driven robot programming to empower non-expert users in human-robot interactions. These systems aim to enable users to give effective feedback, improving the program's accuracy, adaptability, and safety.

Currently, I am working on developing methods that allow users to interact intuitively with LLM-driven robots, ensuring robustness and reliability in dynamic, real-world settings. I believe that by refining feedback processes and implementing safeguards, we can mitigate errors and improve the reliability of LLMs, making robot programming accessible and effective for diverse user groups.
