Hi, I am a fourth-year PhD student in the [People and Robots Laboratory](https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/staff/kim-callie/) at the Computer Sciences Department of University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by [Bilge Mutlu](http://bilgemutlu.com).

My research centers on advancing user feedback mechanisms and enhancing reliability in LLM-driven robot programming. I focus on developing human-centered systems that empower non-experts to provide effective feedback, improving the quality and dependability of AI-driven robotic applications.

Currently, I am exploring interactive feedback frameworks to refine LLM-generated robot programs. By integrating user insights with systematic evaluation, I aim to bridge the gap between expert and non-expert programming, ultimately making LLM-based robotics solutions more robust and accessible.
