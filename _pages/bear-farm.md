## Overview

Bear Farm is a mobile VR game that can be played with Google Cardboard. It uses a Bluetooth controller to make the player move and interact within the game. The game's main content is collecting various teddy bears by increasing their numbers.

## Gameplay

In the **daytime**, the player can interact with the teddy bears, and bears can be collected by completing specific quests.

In the **nighttime**, the player has to protect their teddy bears from thieves. This mini game's goals are keeping the teddy bears safe and earning a high score by successfully shooting the thieves.

## Target Audience

Our project's target users are teens and young adults who want to relieve stress by interacting with cute teddy bears. We expect players to feel relaxed and comfortable while watching or interacting with the bears. Players can also have extra fun and relieve stress by shooting the thieves and achieving a high score.
