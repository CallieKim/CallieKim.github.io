## Research Projects

<div class="project-grid">

<div class="project-card">
  <h3>RoboCritics</h3>
  <p>An approach that augments LLM-based robot programming with expert-informed motion-level critics that analyze execution traces for safety violations, surface transparent feedback, and offer one-click fixes, enabling iterative refinement while keeping users in the loop.</p>

<div class="project-card">
  <h3>RoboBlocks</h3>
  <p>Block-based scaffolding system that helps non-expert users express task intent for robot programming.</p>
